\title{Install quartify RStudio Snippets}
\usage{
install_quartify_snippets(backup = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{backup}{Logical. If TRUE (default), creates a backup of your existing
snippets file before modifying it.}
}
\value{

}
\description{
Installs useful RStudio snippets for working with quartify. These snippets
help you quickly insert common structures when writing R scripts that will
be converted to Quarto documents.
}
\details{
The following snippets are installed:

- **header**: Insert a standard R script header with Title, Author, Date, and Description
- **callout**: Insert a Quarto callout structure
- **mermaid**: Insert a Mermaid diagram chunk
- **tabset**: Insert a tabset structure


The snippets are installed in your RStudio snippets file for R
(`~/.R/snippets/r.snippets` on Unix/Mac or
`%APPDATA%/RStudio/snippets/r.snippets` on Windows).

If you already have custom snippets, this function will append the quartify
snippets to your existing file, avoiding duplicates.

After installation, restart RStudio or reload the window for the snippets
to become available. Then, simply type the snippet name (e.g., `header`)
and press Tab to insert the template.
